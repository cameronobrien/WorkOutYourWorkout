Finish fixing the authentication features. 
Major issues:
	-Passwords do not seem to be hashing the same way with check_password 
	 as they do on hashpw. salt=gensalt(12) is likely generating a new
         salt everytime the helpers.py file is accessed. Maybe try a static
         salt that you set yourself? *SOLUTION LOCATED*

Work on the dashboard page.
Things to remember:
	-Needs to be lightweight and easy to use.
	-Possible fields or portions of the page can be:
	   -Avatar, name, etc on the top left "Welcome, $user!"
           -A "feed" where you can see workouts friends generate and 
           complete.
           -An easy way to generate a new workout directly from the dashboard
           -Edit profile, make new posts, etc
	   -Navbar should include like search, friends, workouts, contact etc

Interface:
	-User input:
	    -Days per week(3, 4, 5, 6)
                -Attempt to evenly space rest days for non-6 input
            -Purpose of training (Strength, hypertrophy, cardio)
		-5 reps for strength at higher weights, 8 reps for hypertrophy, 15+ for cardio
                -85% 1RM for strength, 70% hypertrophy, 50% cardio
            -1RM for compound lifts (squat, bench press, overhead press, deadlift)
            	-1RM can save to profile for easy access at a later date
            -If user just wants cardio with no weights, recommend a generic HIIT program
            -Attempt to combine 2 to 3 muscle groups into one day, with at least one
             compound lift per day, and 2-4 movements per muscle group.
